# GreenCap

It internally deploys an AI-inspired algorithm that utilizes load shifting for IoT-enabled Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS), considering optimization algorithms, integration of renewable energy sources, multiple constraints, peak demand times, and dynamic pricing. 

The GreenCap Controller has been developed by researchers and students at the Data Management Systems Laboratory (DMSL), Department of Computer Science at the University of Cyprus.

### Preface
The GreenCap is an innovative memetic algorithm that enables users to find an energy efficient allocation plan for the operation of a set of IoT devices, a pool of preference rules and a tentative peak-demand history, reducing at the same time CO2 emissions and the imported energy from the grid.

In case you have any publications resulting from the GreenCap platform, please cite the following paper(s):


We hope that you find our GreenCap useful for your research and innovation activities.  We would like to have your feedback, comments and remarks and of course any experiences and test results from your own experimental setups. Questions and feedback may be sent to greencap@cs.ucy.ac.cy

Enjoy GreenCap!
